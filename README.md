# DriveValue Nigeria - Nigerian Car Price Predictor

This is a machine learning web application that predicts the market price of used cars in Nigeria. Users can input car details and instantly receive an estimated price in Naira.

The model is built using a Random Forest Regressor and includes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model explainability, helping users understand which features influence the predicted price.
